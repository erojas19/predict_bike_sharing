# Predicting Bike-Sharing Data 
## Introduction
I have learnt neural networks basics, and build `your first network` with Python and NumPy. I have defined and trained a multi-layer neural network, and used it to analyze real data. In this project, neural networks has been build and train from scratch to predict the number of bike-share users on a given day.
## Instructions
1. Download the project materials from this GitHub repository. You can get download the repository with git clone.
2. cd into the `p1 - Predicting Bike-Sharing Pattern` directory.
3. Make sure you have miniconda or anaconda installed.
4. Create a new conda environment:
`conda create --name deep-learning python=3`
5. Enter your new environment:
`Mac/Linux: >> source activate deep-learning`
`Windows: >> activate deep-learning`
6. Ensure you have numpy, matplotlib, pandas, and jupyter notebook installed by doing the following:
`conda install numpy matplotlib pandas jupyter notebook`
7. Run the following to open up the notebook server:
`jupyter notebook`
8. In your browser, open Predicting_bike_sharing_data.ipynb. 
9. Follow the instructions in the notebook; they will lead you through the project. You'll ultimately be editing the my_answers.py python file, whose components are imported into the notebook at various places.
